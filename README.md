## Future ()

* Tekst dla zachowania bajeru z przypisem.
There are over [300 open requests][issues], some that have been open for years. These need
reviewing and dividing into obvious fixes, or additional new features that need some cartographic
judgement. The work done already in v1.0 and v2.0 will make it much easier to process these.
